# Autoencoder
* An unsupervised learning technique.
* Takes an image input and try to reconstruct it using fewer number of bits from the bottle neck, also known as latent space.
* Autoencoders are similar to dimensionallity reduction techniques like PCA.
* PCA uses linear transformation whereas autoencoders use non-linear transformation.
# About Repository
* Using Autoencoders to classify the images of Fashion-MNIST Dataset.
* Implimenting additional layers to reduce the gap between training and testing loss and accuracy curves respectively.
* The notebook goes brief into the concept and implementation of autoencoders.
