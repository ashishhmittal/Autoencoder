# Autoencoder
* An unsupervised learning technique.
* Takes an image input and try to reconstruct it using fewer number of bits from the bottle neck, also known as latent space.
* Autoencoders are similar to dimensionallity reduction techniques like PCA.
* PCA uses linear transformation whereas autoencoders use non-linear transformation.
